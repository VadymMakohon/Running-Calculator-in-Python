Welcome to the Running Conversion Calculator! This Python program helps runners predict their running pace, distance, or time based on their preferences. Additionally, it can estimate race times and suggest training paces tailored to individual performance.

## Features
- Pace Calculation: Determine your average pace given a specific time and distance.
- Distance Calculation: Compute the distance you've run based on your pace and total time.
- Time Calculation: Find out how long it will take to run a certain distance at your chosen pace.
- Race Time Prediction: Estimate your race completion time for various distances using your current performance metrics.
- Training Pace Recommendations: Receive suggested paces for different training runs, including easy runs, tempo runs, VO2 max workouts, speed sessions, and long runs.
- VO2 Max Estimation: Calculate an estimate of your VO2 max based on your performance, gender, and body weight.
